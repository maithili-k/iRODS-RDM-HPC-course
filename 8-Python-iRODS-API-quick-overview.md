## Goal
You will learn how to interact with iRODS via the python API. In this module we will explore the API in interactive mode. You will:

- Explore the python API to iRODS in ipython
- Upload and download data and collections
- List metadata

## 1. Explore the python API to iRODS in ipython

### 1.1 Set up

If you have followed the earlier modules in this training, you should have performed the following steps already 

- Logged in the Lisa compute cluster
- Cloned the github repository on the Lisa compute cluster (https://github.com/ccacciari/iRODS-RDM-HPC-course.git)

On the login node of the Lisa compute cluster, you have access to *ipython* interpreter, the python package *irods* and you will install [python-irodsclient](https://github.com/irods/python-irodsclient). The login node behaves like any compute node in a cluster, i.e. when your code works here, it will also work on the compute nodes. Later on you will create a script that calls the workflow and runs it on several remote worker nodes without any direct interaction of us.


Install the *irods-pythonclient*:

```
module load 2022
module load iRODS-iCommands/4.3.0
pip3 install python-irodsclient
```

Start an ipython session (first time doing this could take some time):

```sh
ipython3
```

## 2. Upload and download data object and collections

### 2.1 Connect to iRODS
You authenticate yourself with an iRODS username and password (this is different from your Lisa credentials). The module *getpass* asks for passwords without printing the input on screen. With en encoding function we prevent that the variable contains the plain password when we pass it to the iRODS server.

```py
import getpass
pw = getpass.getpass().encode()
```
Now we can create an iRODS session:
```
from irods.session import iRODSSession
session = iRODSSession(host='rsc-test1.irods.surfsara.nl', port=1247, user='irods-user1', password=pw.decode(), zone='surfZone1')
```

Note that you will need to change the username to the one you are given. Throughout this course we will assume you are `irods-user1`. 

You can test whether we have done everything correctly and have access:

```py
coll = session.collections.get('/surfZone1/home/irods-user1')
print(coll.path)
print(coll.data_objects)
print(coll.subcollections)
```

We will need our home collection more often as reference point, so let us store the collection path:

```py
iHome = coll.path
```
 
### 2.2 Upload a data object
The preferred way to upload data to iRODS is a data object *put*. Now we create the logical path and Alice in wonderland file (alice.txt)to iRODS (similar to previous exercise:

```py
iPath = iHome+'/alice.txt'
session.data_objects.put('alice.txt', iPath)
```

Run the command again:

```py
session.data_objects.put('alice.txt', iPath)
```
Now try editing the alice.txt file and run the command again. You can login from another terminal and edit the file e.g., with a vi editor


```py
session.data_objects.put('alice.txt', iPath)
```
Do you know why you do not get an error now?

> * Try to put data to an undefined path or your neighbours home collection (spelling mistake ...)


The object carries some vital system information, otherwise it is empty. 

```
obj = session.data_objects.get(iPath)
print("Name: ", obj.name)
print("Owner: ", obj.owner_name)
print("Size: ", obj.size)
print("Checksum:", obj.checksum)
print("Create: ", obj.create_time)
print("Modify: ", obj.modify_time)
print("Metadata: ", obj.metadata.items())
```

Less code to write to display the full object:
```hashlib.md5(open(
vars(obj)
```

**Remark**: iRODS stores times in UNIX [epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) time, but the python client always returns times in UTC (2 hours behind our local time).


### 2.4 Download a data object
We can download a data object as follows (note that we use the environment variable 'HOME' that is defined to be your Lisa homefolder):

```py
import os
localpath = os.environ['HOME']+'/'+os.path.basename(obj.path)
obj = session.data_objects.get(obj.path,localpath)
os.path.exists(localpath)
```

Now try running the command again.


```py
obj = session.data_objects.get(obj.path,localpath)
```
Do you know why do you get an error now?

**Exercise** Calculate the MD5 checksum for the downloaded data and compare with the data object's checksum in iRODS. (hint: `import hashlib; hashlib.md5(open('<filename>', 'rb').read()).hexdigest()`
